Credit Scoring Model
This project aims to develop a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data. The model uses machine learning classification algorithms (Random Forest) to make predictions.

Files Included:
credit_data.csv: The dataset containing financial information.
Credit_Scoring_Model.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook with the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
credit_scoring_model.pkl: The trained machine learning model.
Steps Followed:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Model Training: Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict creditworthiness.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report, and AUC-ROC score.
Model Deployment: Saved the trained model for future use.
How to Use the Model:
Load the model using joblib or pickle.
Preprocess new input data in the same way as the training data.
Use the model's predict() method to make predictions on new data.
